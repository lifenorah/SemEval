The risk of removing the uterus during a caesarean section for placenta previea is less than 0.5%, however, if the placenta is abnormally attached the the wall of the uterus, the risk will increase but usually less than 1%, and certainly increase if the woman had previously had several cesarean sections. The second question: there is no upper number of how many caesarean sections a woman can have, but the more the number the more the . complication,therefore we advise such women to have a "smaller" family.
