It is considered that a thickness of more than 15 mm is an indication that there may well be tissues remained inside the uterus. Now you have the choice, either to wait and repeat the ultrasound scan after 10-14 days, you may pass all the tissues remaining, or have the operation particularly if you have heavy bleeding. Regards
