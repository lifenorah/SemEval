Dr Athamneh confused two drugs with similar names The first is Tranax which is used in treating anxiety problems and other similar conditions as explained by Dr Athamneh; but not used to treat heaven periods therefore most likely not the drug you are talking about. the other medicine which is tranexamic acid and this is one that is used to treat heaven periods;; and i believe you are using this one. I explained its use in first my first answer.
